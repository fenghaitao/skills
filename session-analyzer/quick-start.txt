Read these files in order before analysis:
1. adk_openspec_apply_agent/apply_agent_instruction.md
2. adk_openspec_apply_agent/apply_implement-wdt-initial_20251214_161520.session.txt
3. openspec-memories/ (browse and select 2-3 relevant files)

ONLY after reading all files, provide analysis with specific quotes from the session. Do NOT give generic advice without reading the actual files.

Focus on:
- Error patterns with frequencies and timestamps
- Specific agent instruction gaps with evidence
- Memory document improvements needed
- Concrete recommendations with expected impact metrics

Quote exact error messages and reference line numbers from the session file.
