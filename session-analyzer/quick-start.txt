Read these files in order before analysis:
1. adk_openspec_apply_agent/apply_agent_instruction.md
2. Find and read the latest .session.txt file in adk_openspec_apply_agent/ directory (typically named apply_[change-id]_[timestamp].session.txt)
3. openspec-memories/ (browse and select 2-3 relevant files)

ONLY after reading all files, provide analysis with specific quotes from the session. Do NOT give generic advice without reading the actual files.

Focus on:
- Error patterns with frequencies and timestamps
- Specific agent instruction gaps with evidence
- Memory document improvements needed
- Concrete recommendations with expected impact metrics

Quote exact error messages and reference line numbers from the session file.

MANDATORY OUTPUT: Create a markdown analysis report file in the project directory using pattern: {component}_implementation_analysis_{YYYYMMDD}.md

QUALITY CHECK: Good analysis should include specific error quotes, timestamps, quantified metrics, and actionable recommendations. If you get generic advice without session specifics, use this recovery prompt:

"Stop. You're giving generic advice. Please:
1. Show me the specific files you read  
2. Quote exact error messages from the session
3. Provide specific text additions for instruction files
If you haven't read the session file, start over with file reading."
